Welcome to your new Hugo blog! This is a sample draft post created to show you the front matter and structure.

- To create new posts use `hugo new posts/<slug>.md` or `hugo new post/<slug>.md` depending on your archetype paths.
- When you're ready to publish, set `draft = false` or run `hugo --minify` and deploy your `public/` folder.

Enjoy writing!
